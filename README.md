## Abstract

Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by high blood glucose levels and insulin deficiency that affects millions of people in the US and around the world. Currently, treatment options are limited to artificially supplying the body with insulin, either via injection or a glucose monitor. Our increasing knowledge of the human microbiome coupled with ongoing advances in synthetic biology enables the development of genetically engineered microbes to diagnose and treat disease; a novel class of therapeutics termed live bacterial therapeutics. We are engineering Staphylococcus epidermidis, a skin microbe, to sense and respond to elevated blood glucose levels via a genetically encoded blood glucose sensor and control system. Our goal is to establish a synthetic transcription response specific to glucose at clinically relevant physiological concentrations, resulting in controlled expression of a single-chain insulin analog. The engineered skin microbes will act as a replacement for the patient’s damaged or fatigued β-cells. This paper investigates the transcriptomic signature of S. epidermidis in response to various glucose concentrations and treatments to identify putative candidates for biosensor switches.
